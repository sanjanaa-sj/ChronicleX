# News App Project

## Project Overview

This project is a simple news app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a third-party news API. I created this website to learn JavaScript, specifically focusing on fetching data from an external API, handling errors, and dynamically displaying information on a webpage. The project helped me gain hands-on experience with modern JavaScript practices and client-server interactions.

### Why I Created This Project

As a beginner in JavaScript, I wanted to build a practical application that would enhance my understanding of how to interact with external data sources and manipulate the DOM. A news app seemed like an ideal project to practice these concepts since it involves fetching live data, handling user input, and updating the UI dynamically based on that data.

## Features

- **Dynamic News Fetching**: Users can search for news articles based on different topics like politics, finance, and sports.
- **Error Handling**: The app handles errors gracefully, displaying error messages when something goes wrong with the data fetching.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be mobile-friendly and adjusts well to different screen sizes.

**Future Improvements** üåü

**Authentication** üîê:
I will implement user authentication, allowing users to securely register, log in, and personalize their experience on the platform.

**UI/UX Improvements** üé®:
I plan to improve the user interface by adding more interactive features like categories or sorting options to enhance usability and the overall look and feel.


This version explains that the News API's 200 hits limit is a current constraint, and you're working on a more flexible solution to overcome this in the future.


## Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience that helped me improve my JavaScript skills. It gave me a deeper understanding of working with external APIs, handling CORS issues, and deploying a project to a serverless platform like Vercel. Despite facing some challenges along the way, I was able to overcome them through research, experimentation, and problem-solving.
